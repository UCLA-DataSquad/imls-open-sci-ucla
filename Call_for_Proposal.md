# Program Overview 
The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Library received an award from the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program this August 2022. With the support of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, UCLA Library Data Science Center is pleased to announce the call for proposals on Lesson creation about open science methods and digital processes. 

This call seeks to support continued skills development for librarians in open science to effectively provide instruction to new researchers and effectively collaborate with faculty and researchers in science projects using open science practices.

We aim to fund projects with high potential for subsequent impact on the open science community. We invite proposals based on diverse intellectual approaches and personal backgrounds to achieve these ends. 

# Program Goals
This program will result in fourteen open science course modules for librarians at any career stage.  These curricula will be published online in an unrestricted and freely available manner for reuse and remixing. These lesson modules will be developed and supported through two virtual summer institutes, and we will use feedback from lesson piloting to test the lessons with librarian learners.

# Proposal Topics 
The proposal should include lesson justification, targeted lesson audience, learning objectives, and lesson content. The lesson is expected to be 2 hours in length. Should you also mention that there is a strong preference towards open resources (like open source tools, open access, essentially resources that are broadly accessible to all)?

We accept proposals with but are not limited to the following topics: 
* What is/Why do Open Science? (FAIR, Guidance/Recommendations)
* Paths to Open Science, Stories, Examples, Use Cases
* Diverse, Equitable, Inclusive Communities (Fostering, Maintaining)
* Writing Open Science (Peer Review Process, Audiences, Forms)
* Linking Open Science, Search & Discovery Systems (Databases/Indexing, PIDs, Semantic Web)
* Team Science (Project Management, Collaborative, Versioning Systems)
* Data/Software Management (Best Practices/Standards, Tidy/Quality/Validating/Testing, Sharing/Publishing)
* Data Science, Modeling, Machine Learning, and AI Ready Data (Standards, Good Practices)
* Open Science in the Cloud (Remote Computing, Virtual Environments, Automation)
* Notebook Science (Reproducibility, Workflows)
* Analysis, Visualization, and Accessibility
* Responsible Conduct of Research (Ethics, Scientific Integrity, AI/ML)
* Community Science (Storytelling, Communicating Science to the Public)
* Open and FAIR Hardware (Making)

# How to Apply
We accept applications from one applicant or several applicants as a group. Applicants can be whoever are interested in open science and teaching and are not limited to librarians. The proposal should be 2-pages in length, with the font as Arial, size of 12, and space of 1.5 lines. References or other supporting materials can be added as Appendix (if needed). All documents need to be in one pdf. Please submit your proposal here.

# Dates 
The deadline for submission is **November 31st, 2022**. Awards will be announced by **Jan. 31st, 2023**. 

# Funding and Support
We will provide each award recipient or group with $xxxxxx for developing a lesson. We will also offer two rounds of summer training workshops (2023 and 2024) to teach the award recipients the necessary skills to build lessons. Besides, we will provide technical support for publishing the developed lessons. 

# Proposal Review and Criteria
An ad hoc faculty committee (A Steering Committee) will evaluate the proposals based on quality, originality, and potential impact (on the campus or the field of study).

# Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion
We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status.
